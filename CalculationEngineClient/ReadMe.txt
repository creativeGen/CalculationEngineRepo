This is a simple console client built with an intention to use the new CalculationEngine which is a class library.
The CalculationEngine.dll is referred from the Lib folder within the client.
In order to test the client, enter one or more arithmetic expressions separated by -:
	For example -
	2.5*9.0 -: 44/22 -: 12 + (5.5*2.3)
	etc...
The delimiter -: has been chosen assuming that no mathematical expression will have a combination of these symbols together.
